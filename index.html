  <h4 class="w3-center"><em>Statistics of the network</em></h4>
  <p> 
In this section we are trying to find out which characters are the most central. These are the most important characters. For this we used different tools such as betweenness centrality, PageRank, eigenvector centrality (for in and out links) and the HITS algorithm (finds Hubs and Authorities). We thus use these different measures to be able to compare them and to see if indeed they capture the most important characters in our network. The tools are rather technical to explain, thus we have explained them in our notebook. 
<p>

  </figure>
  <!--</p>-->
  <p></p>
<p> 
In the above graph you can see the results of the different measures. These were normalized so the maximum is at 100% and the following are percentages of this maximum.
</p> 

<p> 
Harry Potter nearly always appears on top. He is just distanciated by Ron on the Hubs and eigenvector centrality out. This is because Harry Potter has plenty of links linking to him. While proportionally Ron has more links linking to other characters (out links). Both of the measures (Hubs and eigenvector centrality out) focus on the out links.
</p> 

<p> 
We notice that the top 5 characters (Harry Potter, Tom Riddle (Voldemort), Dumbledore, Ron and Hermione) in all the measures are the most important characters in the Harry Potter universe (or at least what we would have said). 
</p> 

<p> 
The next 9 characters are all still important but more side characters in the Harry Potter universe. Except from Sirius Black they appear in all the books.
</p> 
<p> 
Dolores Umbridge is more special. She is the headmaster of Hogwarts in book 5: “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix”. Thus she is very important in book 5 but otherwise she only appears in book 7 for a minor role. 
</p> 
<p> 
The last 5 characters of the plot represent less famous characters that only appear in one or two Harry Potter book. Some of the names were even not that familiar to us. We can thus take into consideration that betweenness centrality is a poor measure to find central nodes in this graph. In our view the best measure for this graph is PageRank that captures the first 10 characters in the plot.
</p> 
<p> 
Finally, we notice a big correlation between the eigenvector out centrality and the Hubs. The same yields for eigenvector in centrality and the Authorities.

  <h3 class="w3-center">COMMUNITY ANALYSIS</h3>

  <p>We will use the Louvain algorithm to analyse the underlying communities in the harry potter network. 

We have thus applied this algorithm to 2 different communities. One the one hand we were interested in the 4 different houses of Hogwarts ( Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff), but on the other hand we were also interested in the interaction between the good and bad guys in Harry Potter. There is in Harry Potter one community of bad guys: the Death Eaters. Yes the name sounds horrible! But also several communities of good guys such as the Order of the Phoenix and the Army of Dumbledore. It seemed thus interesting to asses these two separated problems.
</p>

  <h3>Image of the houses network</h3>
  <p>
    <center><img src="Figures/Community/Graph_house.png" width="100%" height="100%"
         alt = "The network of the main characters" /></center>
  </p>
  <p>Here is a plot of network with only the House members. Red nodes are Gryffindor nodes. Green nodes are Slytherin nodes. Yellow nodes are Hufflepuff nodes. Blue nodes are Ravenclaw nodes.

  We notice in the center a higher density of Gryffindor nodes. This makes sense since in Harry Potter, the main house (the house of Harry Potter) is Gryffindor.
</p>

<p>
We had a problem since not all of our nodes had a house or a good or bad label. We thus only kept the nodes that had such a label and the edges between these nodes. We have plotted our results in a confusion matrix in order to make our results more visual. The confusion matrix is a table to compare two different sets of non-overlapping communities.
A number in the square (with row i and column j), is the number of characters that are in both community corresponding to row i and community corresponding to row j. We will use the confusion matrix to compare the communities that are naturally present in Harry Potter (houses, Good and Bad Guys) versus the communities found by the Louvain algorithm (these have no name and thus are just numbered).
</p>

  </p>
  <p>In this figure the communites</p>

 <p>
This matrix tells us that the categories of houses are not so good to distinguish the different communities. The only community that is somewhat better captured is the slytherin house. On the one hand, we see that the community 3 we have a vast majority of Slytherins. This is also the case in community 6.  On the other hand we distinguish community 2 which has members of several different houses but only one from Slytherin.

  <p>Death eaters versus the Good guys</p>
<p>
A first observation here is that there are way more good than bad guys. This is because we took several different lists for the Good Guys :'First Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore's Army and the Order of the Phoenix allies. While we only had one interesting list for the bad Guys: the Death Eaters.

We see though that the distinction is pretty good! In the first community all but one are members of Dumbledore's Army. The 3rd community captures the vast majority of the Death Eaters. We notice that people who were in the frontline to fight against the death eaters such as Severus Snape, Neville’s parents or Sirius Black end up in this community also. The two remaining community contain other good guys but it is harder to see a deep structure.

  <p>
The aim of the sentimental analysis is to understand more about the sentiment in the Harry Potter world. 
Find the darkest and happiest books and discover if the books and the movie are telling the same sentimental story.
Firstly, we are interested in the book's sentiments. We start with a deep understanding of the books page by page. The sentiment of the pages will guide our analysis.


  </p>

  <p>
How can a page have sentiment? We have a big list of super common and used English words and a happiness grade for each one. The grade is based on the comparison and grading on average of the words taken from Twitter, Google Books (English), music lyrics (1960 to 2007), and the New York Times (1987 to 2007). Then, the sentiment of a page will be the average of the sentiments of the words on the page.


  </p>

  <p>
Using same functions on Python, we have one plot for each movie with the sentiment profile of that book. A sentiment profile is a graph that has the sentiment on the y-axis and position in the text on the x-axis. The effect of changing the size of the sliding window is that it changes the amount of text we are taking in consideration. Starting with 15 words we capture the moving average of the sentiment of a few sentences. Increasing the window the moving average will say more about the whole book and can capture a more important flow. In a page there are usually around 500 words. Using one page as the window, it is possible to follow how the sentiment will change page by page.

  <p>
The sentiment profile of the books is different: the maximum and minimum sentiment seem to be the same, but they behave differently. However, from book 5 the range will be bigger, spreading in the negative emotion. This could be due to fact that the children who were reading the first 4 books now are guys who can start to read some scarring, creepy and sad moments.
  </p>

  <p>
We cannot find a book which has a calm behavior around the average. All books, instead, have lot of up and down with a jagged profile and sudden changes. This is what we expect from this book, where there are very happy and sad events.


  </p>
For instance in book 1, Harry meets for the first time Voldemort and this is really clear from the sentiment profile. In the books there are also deeply sad moments like in book 2 when Harry is fighting Tom Riddle or in books 5 and 6 when respectively both Sirius Black and Dumbledore die. These moments are really clear in the sentiment profile with high and low peak.

  <p>
We now take in consideration the subtitles of the 8 movies (book 7 was filmed in 2 parts). We want to visualize the sentiment in the movies, find the most sentimental moments. And than compare these moments with the one found in the books. Our goal is to find the difference between books and movies.

On average the saddest movie is Movie 1 and Movie 6, the happiest ones are Movie 8 (part 2 of book 7) and Movie 4. However, all books have negative average sentiment. But let’s take a look closer. In movie 1 “Harry Potter and the sorcerer’s stone” there is a super happy moment at 2:12:00. Now we want to double check in the movie which moment is it. This scene is when Harry, Ron, and Hermione play their way across a chessboard to pass the White players in a giant-scaled and dangerous game of Wizard Chess. In order for our heroes to pass, they have to play deadly moves as Harry, Ron, and Hermione are part of the Black pieces as a Bishop, Knight, and Castle (Rook). After Ron's sacrifice, there is a so sentimental speech between Harry and Hermione speaking about true friendship and courage.

  <p>
 In movie 3 “The prisoner of Azkaban”  the saddest moment in when Sirius Black ‘wants’ to kill Harry and Hermione proposes to sacrifice herself to protect Harry.

<body>

  <p>
In movie 4 “Harry Potter and the goblet of fire” starts with the saddest moment when Harry has a nightmare about Voldemort killing the castle housekeeper.  The saddest moment ever in all movies is in the last movie “Harry Potter deathly hallows part 2” at 1:02:00. The death eaters are conquering Hogwarts and Voldemort kills Snape. This moment has an average sentiment is -1 which is the lowest value in the harry potter movies.
  </p>

  <p>
Harry Potter fans know that there is a world of difference between the magical books and their respective film adaptations. While the Potter movies are nostalgic and possess a special charm of their own, there is a huge amount of detail that doesn't translate from the page to the screen. What is clear from the sentiment profile is that both are built to leave the reader and watcher in the grey area because there is a very sad moment and lot emotional up and down at the end of every books and movies. The most important events are present of course in both: in book 1 the second saddest moment is the chess game, which is also the saddest moment in movie 1. It’s possible to find a lot of parallels between them.
  </p>

  <p>
In conclusion, we found an efficient way to detect and investigate the sentiment moment in the books and movies. We double checked the most sentimental moment and the turning points of the books in the movies and vice versa. It allowed us to understand more about how a movie is structured and why these movies are so passionate.
